Brief architectural notes.

Image names (IM): some source of URLs for image files. Right now, this is just the result of a
                  directory crawl, but in principle, it could come from anywhere

InfoList (IL): the info list is the primary driver of the UI. It is a list of ImageInfo, and it
               is only ever accessed through the main thread. (The ImageInfo objects it contains
               should also only be accessed on the main thread.)

Pipeline (PIPE): receives image URLs and pushes the images from one "handler" to the next.
                 Each handler will receive a (URL, CGImage) pair, and returns a Closure which
                 can manipulate the ImageInfo on the main thread. The pipeline runs primarily on
                 background threads so that work can be done without janking the UI.
                 The pipeline assumes that the ImageInfo for the URL is already present in the
                 InfoList.
